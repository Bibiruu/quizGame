Had a light styling with the style tag with only background color.
Gave to all the radio button per question its common group name and gave then all a unique id to recognize in the script part the correct answers
in the argument of true. 
Made a function that calculated all the correct answers in True and printed the total answers with a performance rate. Less than 1 <= Poor performance
Score <=3 You'r okay and Score <=5 great performance. 
The calculation of score happens in a button click.
